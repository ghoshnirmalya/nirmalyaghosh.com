title: 'What is TailwindCSS and what problems does this new CSS framework solve for us'
---

> In this tutorial, we'll learn what is the problem with component-based styling and why we need utility-based styles. Also, we'll explore [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which is a utility-first CSS framework. We'll also learn about how to install, configure and learn TailwindCSS with a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app.

As a front-end developer, I've worked on projects having a large codebase. The most common problem that arises after a prolonged period of development is managing styles and this problem is very [common](https://css-tricks.com/oh-no-stylesheet-grows-grows-grows-append-stylesheet-problem/). Although we've many CSS architectures like [Atomic CSS](https://acss.io/), [BEM](http://getbem.com/), [ITCSS](https://itcss.io/), [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/), etc., we still have the problem with managing them. Added to this, we can also have [CSS performance issues](https://csswizardry.com/2018/11/css-and-network-performance/) as well.

In the codebase which I was working on, we started with BEM for writing HTML and CSS. In a sub-module of that project, we'd used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Also, in some legacy code of that codebase, we've custom CSS that wasn't following any convention.

While all these CSS architecture tries to help us solve these kinds of problems, it'd been easier if we could just write utility class and then use them repeatedly in our codebase. These utility classes would be exhaustive and could be present as a standalone guideline for `padding`, `margin`, `font-size`, etc.

Using utility classes would solve the problem of duplicate styles as we wouldn't need to write anymore custom style definitions. Moreover, if our styleguide follows a particular standard, we could also follow the same in development. One such utility framework is [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Getting started with TailwindCSS

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework which aims to provide us with a set of utlity classes (like `flex`, `block`, `inline-block`, etc.). In addition to that, it also provides us utility classes to create [CSS grids](https://tailwindcss.com/components/grids), [responsive designs](https://tailwindcss.com/course/responsive-design/#app) as well as style [hover, focus and active](https://tailwindcss.com/course/hover-focus-and-active-styles) pseudo-classes.

I'd be using TailwindCSS with [React](https://reactjs.org/). However, the same principles will apply to any framework, library as well only HTML.

## Installing TailwindCSS

We'll use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to bootstrap our project. To do that, we'll have to run the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Next, we need to go inside the `my-app` directory and [install TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#1-install-tailwind-via-npm):

```bash
cd my-app && yarn add tailwindcss
```

If you prefer `npm`, you can run the following command instead of the above one:

```bash
cd my-app && npm install tailwindcss
```

Next, we need to use the @tailwind directive to inject Tailwind's base, components, and utilities styles into our CSS. To do that we need to add the following code to our `src/styles/vendors.css` file:

```scss
// src/styles/vendor.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Next, we need to add the `build:style` script to our `package.json` file:

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject",
  "build:style": "tailwind build src/styles/vendors.css -o src/styles/tailwind.css" //highlight-line
},
```

Now, the `build:style` command will generate a new `src/styles/tailwind.css` file whenever we run it:

![Generating new tailwind.css file](../static/images/content/what-is-tailwind-css/1.png)

Next, we need to add the generated file to our `src/App.js` file:

```jsx
// src/App.js
import React from 'react'
import logo from './logo.svg'
import './App.css'
import './styles/tailwind.css' // highlight-line
```

That's all we need to do to make TailwindCSS work with Create React App. To verify whether TailwindCSS is working or not, we can add a TailwindCSS class. We can add the `bg-blue-900` class to our `<header>` in `src/App.js` file:

```jsx
// src/App.js
<div className="App">
  <header className="App-header bg-blue-900"> {/* highlight-line */}
    <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
    <p>
      Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
    </p>
```

Now, if we can run our server using the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

Once our server is up and running, we can visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/):

![Changing the background color of header using TailwindCSS](../static/images/content/what-is-tailwind-css/2.png)

We can see that the `background-color` has changed to `#2a4365` which is listed on [TailwindCSS background color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color/#app).

## Configuring TailwindCSS

By default, [the size of Tailwind is 78.0kb (gzipped)](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size) compared to Bootstrap's 22.7kb (gzipped). But, this size can be reduced using a number of [strategies](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size). We won't go through all of them. However, we'll configure using [Tailwind config file](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration/) to reduce the size.

First, we need to generate a Tailwind config file. We can do that by running the following command:

```bash
npx tailwind init
```

![Generating the Tailwind config file](../static/images/content/what-is-tailwind-css/3.png)

This will create a new file `tailwind.config.js` at the root of our project:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Through this configuration file, we can [override Tailwind's default color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#overriding-the-default-color-palette) or [extend it](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#extending-the-default-palette). We can also [disable certain colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#disabling-a-default-color).

Now, let's say we want to use Tailwind in your existing codebase. Our existing codebase already has a bunch of custom CSS styles defined in it. It's highly likely that we might have defined some custom utility classes (like `text-red`, `text-bold`, `block`, `flex`, etc.). The problem which arises now is that the Tailwind utility classes might interfere with our existing classes. We can solve that problem by adding a [prefix](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration/#prefix) to all of Tailwind's generated utility classes.

For example, if we want to add the prefix `u-` ('u' stands for utility) to Tailwind's classes, we just need to add that to the configuration file we generated above:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  prefix: 'u-', // highlight-line
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Now, if we build our styles again using `yarn build:style`, we'll get classes like `u-bg-blue-900`. Let's replace `bg-blue-900` to `u-bg-blue-900` in our `src/App.js` file:

```js
// src/App.js
<div className="App">
  <header className="App-header u-bg-blue-900"> // highlight-line
    <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
    <p>
```

Now, if we visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), we'll see that it's same as before.

We can also add [plugins](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration/#plugins) as well as modify the [separator](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration/#separator).

If we see that the Tailwind classes are not reflecting on the browser, it could be due to the fact that some other classes are overriding the styles provided by Tailwind. To solve that problem, we can [configure](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration/#important) Tailwind to always use `!important` after each class.

To do that we just need to add the following code to the configuration file:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  prefix: 'u-',
  important: true, // highlight-line
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Now, if we build our styles again using `yarn build:style`, we'll get styles like:

```scss
// src/styles/tailwind.css
.u-bg-gray-900 {
  background-color: #1a202c !important;
}
```

> I wouldn't suggest using `!important` as it's [not always the best solution](https://uxengineer.com/css-specificity-avoid-important-css/) for solving CSS specificity issues.

## Using it with React

After we're done integrating TailwindCSS with our React project, let's develop a page using TailwindCSS.

First, let's remove all the code from our `src/App.js` file and then remove the `src/App.css`, `src/App.test.js` and `src/logo.svg` files.

![Removing unnecessary files](../static/images/content/what-is-tailwind-css/4.png)

Our `src/App.js` file should look like the following:

```js
// src/App.js
import React from 'react'

import './styles/tailwind.css'

function App() {
  return <div>TailwindCSS with React!</div>
}

export default App
```

We're now in a position to develop our first page using React and style it with TailwindCSS. We'll add a navbar first and then, we'll add a card to the page. To create the navbar, we can look at the [Responsive Header](https://tailwindcss.com/components/navigation/#responsive-header) example component from Tailwind.

Let's introduce that component into our `src/App.js` file:

```js
// src/App.js
import React from 'react'

import './styles/tailwind.css'

function App() {
  return (
    <nav className="flex items-center justify-between flex-wrap bg-teal-500 p-6">
      <div className="flex items-center flex-shrink-0 text-white mr-6">
        <svg
          className="fill-current h-8 w-8 mr-2"
          width="54"
          height="54"
          viewBox="0 0 54 54"
          xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        >

        </svg>
        <span className="font-semibold text-xl tracking-tight">
          Tailwind CSS
        </span>
      </div>
      <div className="block lg:hidden">
        <button className="flex items-center px-3 py-2 border rounded text-teal-200 border-teal-400 hover:text-white hover:border-white">

          </svg>
        </button>
      </div>
      <div className="w-full block flex-grow lg:flex lg:items-center lg:w-auto">
        <div className="text-sm lg:flex-grow">

          >
            Examples
          </a>
          <a
            href="#responsive-header"
            className="block mt-4 lg:inline-block lg:mt-0 text-teal-200 hover:text-white"
          >
            Blog
          </a>
        </div>
        <div>
          <a
            href="#"
            className="inline-block text-sm px-4 py-2 leading-none border rounded text-white border-white hover:border-transparent hover:text-teal-500 hover:bg-white mt-4 lg:mt-0"
          >
            Download
          </a>
        </div>
      </div>
    </nav>
  )
}

export default App
```

If we visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), it'll look like the following:

![Page without styles](../static/images/content/what-is-tailwind-css/5.png)

Our page looks like it's without styles. This is because we've prefixed with `u-` in our Tailwind configuration file. Let's remove that for now so that our `tailwind.config.js` file looks like the following:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  important: true,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

If we run `yarn build:style`, Tailwind will generate a new set of classes and update our `src/styles/tailwind.css` file with them.

If we visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), it'll now look like the following:

![Page with navbar styles](../static/images/content/what-is-tailwind-css/6.png)

Now, it looks as expected. Let's now add a card component to this. We just need to add the following code to our `src/App.js` file:

```js
// src/App.js
<div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen bg-gray-200">
  <div className="max-w-md">
    <div className="rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
      <img
        className="w-full"
        src="https://tailwindcss.com/img/card-top.jpg"
        alt="Sunset in the mountains"
      />
      <div className="px-6 py-4 bg-white">
        <div className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">The Coldest Sunset</div>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptatibus
          quia, nulla! Maiores et perferendis eaque, exercitationem praesentium
          nihil.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="px-6 py-4 bg-gray-100">
        <span className="inline-block bg-gray-300 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2">
          #photography
        </span>
        <span className="inline-block bg-gray-300 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2">
          #travel
        </span>
        <span className="inline-block bg-gray-300 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700">
          #winter
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

> You'll need to wrap the whole `App` function with `<React.Fragment>` as React doesn't allow a component to return multiple elements.

If we visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), it should now look like the following:

![Page with navbar and card styles](../static/images/content/what-is-tailwind-css/7.png)

This is how we expected our page to look like.

## Extracting components

Till now, we designed the whole page inside one single file. However, we'll most probably have multiple components inside an actual app. We might also want to re-use the same navbar across many pages (we can also add the navbar to a common parent file). Also, we might to re-use the card component as well. So, let's try to extract the card component in a separate file.

Let's create a new file `src/Card.js` and move the card styles from `src/App.js` file to that file:

```js
// src/Card.js
import React from 'react'

function Card() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-md">
      <div className="rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
        <img
          className="w-full"
          src="https://tailwindcss.com/img/card-top.jpg"
          alt="Sunset in the mountains"
        />
        <div className="px-6 py-4 bg-white">
          <div className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">The Coldest Sunset</div>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
            Voluptatibus quia, nulla! Maiores et perferendis eaque,
            exercitationem praesentium nihil.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="px-6 py-4 bg-gray-100">
          <span className="inline-block bg-gray-300 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2">
            #photography
          </span>
          <span className="inline-block bg-gray-300 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2">
            #travel
          </span>
          <span className="inline-block bg-gray-300 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700">
            #winter
          </span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Card
```

Let's import that Card component into our `src/App.js` file:

```js
// src/App.js
import React from 'react'

import Card from './Card' // highlight-line

import './styles/tailwind.css'

function App() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <nav className="flex items-center justify-between flex-wrap bg-teal-500 p-6">
        <div className="flex items-center flex-shrink-0 text-white mr-6">
          <svg
            className="fill-current h-8 w-8 mr-2"
            width="54"
            height="54"
            viewBox="0 0 54 54"

      <div className="flex justify-around h-screen bg-gray-200 pt-24">
        <Card /> // highlight-line
      </div>
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}

export default App
```

Let's add two more `Card` components to our `src/App.js` file:

```js
// src/App.js

<div className="flex justify-around h-screen bg-gray-200 pt-24">
  <Card />
  // highlight-start
  <Card />
  <Card />
  // highlight-end
</div>
```

If we visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), we'll see three cards now:

> We can also do the same thing for navbar as well. We can create a navbar component using the code which is related to navbar.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learnt how to use TailwindCSS to build scalable front-end applications. We've also noticed that we can design, develop and ship front-end applications much faster as we don't have to worry about writing custom CSS styles any more. Our applications will become more maintainable as we don't have to worry about removing CSS styles. Tailwind also has a section describing about how to [control file size](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/#app).

Tailwind [supports](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/browser-support) IE11 and all the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
