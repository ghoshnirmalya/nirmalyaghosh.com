I wanted to built an application which will have [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/) serving the front-end while the back-end will be powered by [Hasura](https://hasura.io/). However, doing a quick [search on Google](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN884IN884&sxsrf=ALeKk00n-5Lebdi67WuA-L5kdCoJAjmY5A%3A1610508668192&ei=fGn-X6aPC5uQ4-EP0--VuA4&q=hasura+next.js+boilerplate&oq=hasura+next.js+boilerplate&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECAAQRzoJCAAQyQMQFhAeOgUIIRCgAToECCEQFToHCCEQChCgAVCVHVjIPGDRQGgAcAJ4AIAB1QGIAcIPkgEGMC4xMy4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwimvcyo_JfuAhUbyDgGHdN3BecQ4dUDCA0&uact=5), I realized that there isn't any good solution or boilerplate from where I can start coding.

As a result, I created this repository from where anyone can start building an application which combines the flexibility of Next.js and the simplicity of Hasura.

I realized that many people have faced a similar hurdle while developing such application. Both Next.js and Hasura are great softwares and it shouldn't be difficult to build an application with them.

Next, you can take a look at all the <Link href="/docs/nextjs-hasura-boilerplate/03-features" text="features" /> that this boilerplate offers or <Link
  href="/docs/nextjs-hasura-boilerplate/04-getting-started"
  text="check out how to create a real-time application"
/>
.
