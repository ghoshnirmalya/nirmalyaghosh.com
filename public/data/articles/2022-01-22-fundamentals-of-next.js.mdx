[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework built on top of the React.js library and provides the best development experience with a host of features like [SSR and SSG](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching), [Image optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization), [support for TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript), [i18n](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing) and many more.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

**[Static Site Generation
(SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props)**
is useful when you want to generate the HTML when the site builds. This can
increase the build time but ensures that no data fetching happens when a page
loads.

<Callout type="info">
  Use SSG when the content of your site doesn't change that often. [The
  blog](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/nirmalyaghosh.com) that your viewing
  right now uses SSG to generate all the pages during build time. When this site
  is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), all the pages of this site gets
  generated.
</Callout>

Play with the component below to visually understand how SSG works in a Next.js application.

**[Server-side Rendering
(SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)**

  the pages of your site requires authentication or authorization. you can use
