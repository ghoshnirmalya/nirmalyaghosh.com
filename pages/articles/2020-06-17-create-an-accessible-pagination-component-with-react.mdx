> In this tutorial, we'll learn all the things that are necessary to build an
accessible pagination component with a good User Experience using React. The source code is available on
[Github](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/react-pagination-component). You can
view a demo of the application [here](https://react-pagination-component.vercel.app/).


## Table of Contents


## What is a Pagination component and where is it used?
A Pagination component helps in fetching and showing data in steps. It's mainly useful in the following scenarios:

1. Lists or tables which consists of a large set of data
2. Cases, where we might want to show data in steps
3. Cases, where a long time will be taken to fetch and show the whole data


## Difference between Pagination and Infinite Scrolling
A Pagination component is useful for fetching fragments of data and showing it
to the user. The user can control when they want to view the next set of data.
In a Pagination component, the user can also control the amount of data that
they want to view.

![View with page-size selector](/images/content/how-to-create-an-accessible-pagination-component-with-react/2.png)

In most cases like in [Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/pagination/)
and [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/addons/pagination/), the user
can also view the data for a particular page directly by typing the number of
that page in a small input box.

![View with page-number selector](/images/content/how-to-create-an-accessible-pagination-component-with-react/3.png)

In an Infinite Scrolling component, initially, a subset of the whole data is
shown. However, when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list or table, the
next set of data is fetched from the server and shown on the browser.

For example, initially a set of 5 records out of 100 records will be fetched from the server and rendered on the list or table. When the user scrolls to the bottom of the list or table, the next 5 records are fetched from the server and shown.

It's also possible that the whole data is fetched initially but the records are
shown lazily. This is done in order to [reduce Cognitive Overload](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/reducing-cognitive-overload-for-a-better-user-experience/).


## When should we use Pagination instead of Infinite Scrolling?
[This article](https://uxplanet.org/ux-infinite-scrolling-vs-pagination-1030d29376f1)
explains the answer for this question in details. However, if an application
needs to remember the scroll-position of the user during page transition, then
it's always better to use pagination. For example, if we have an e-commerce
application, we'll need to remember the scroll-position of the user in case of a
page transition.


## Types of Pagination
Effectively, there are two types of pagination:
1. Client-side pagination
2. Server-side pagination

We'll be talking about both of these in details.


## Client-side Pagination
![Client-side pagination](/images/content/how-to-create-an-accessible-pagination-component-with-react/4.png)

In this type of pagination, the whole data is fetched from the server but is
shown on the browser in steps. There can be certain cases in which the pagination
can't be implemented on the server. In those cases, the pagination is generally
done on the client-side.

This type of pagination can be achieved in the following ways:
1. Fetch all the records from the server
2. Divide the records into certain parts based on a certain limit per page
3. Show a set of records on each page
4. Show the next set of records when the user clicks on the next page and so on
5. Sorting, searching and filtering of records is done on the client-side


## Server-side Pagination
![Server-side pagination](/images/content/how-to-create-an-accessible-pagination-component-with-react/5.png)

In this type of pagination, the records are fetched from the server in steps.
This is a better way of doing pagination because of the following:
1. Size of API requests are smaller since they are fetched in chunks
2. The load on both the Server and Client is lesser since they've lesser data to
   deal with. On the Server-side, since the number of records is lesser,
   computing time for generating those records will be lesser as compared to
   computing all the records. This might not be noticeable if the total number
   of records aren't much but when we're fetching thousand records vs ten
   records, this will be noticeable. On the Client-side, if the number of
   records are lesser, there will be lesser load on the browser to parse the
   data and show it to the user.

![Server-side pagination view](/images/content/how-to-create-an-accessible-pagination-component-with-react/6.png)

This type of pagination can be achieved in the following ways:
1. Fetch only the necessary records from the server for a particular page
2. Show the fetched records for that particular page
3. Fetch and show the next set of records when the user clicks on the next page and so on
4. Sorting, searching and filtering of records is done on the server-side


## Building a simple Pagination component using React
In this step, we'll build a simple Pagination component using
[React](https://reactjs.org/) and the [Hacker News
API](https://hn.algolia.com/api). We'll be building a server-side paginated
component.

Let's start with creating a new directory for our component:

```bash
mkdir react-pagination-component
```

The above command will create a new directory called
**react-pagination-component**.

We'll be using [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) to manage our
dependencies.

> If you don't have Yarn installed on your machine, you can check out their
> [Installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Let's initialize our package using Yarn inside our
**react-pagination-component** directory:

```bash
cd react-pagination-component && yarn init
```

The above command will show an output similar to the following on our terminal:

```bash
question name (react-pagination-component):
question version (1.0.0): 0.0.1
question description: A simple pagination component for React.js
question entry point (index.js):
question repository url:
question author: Nirmalya Ghosh (nirmalya.email@gmail.com)
question license (MIT):
question private: false
success Saved package.json
✨  Done in 95.33s.
```

It'll also generate the following **package.json** file:

```json:package.json
{
  "name": "react-pagination-component",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A simple pagination component for React.js",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "Nirmalya Ghosh (nirmalya.email@gmail.com)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": false
}
```

Doing the above steps would help us in installing [npm
packages](https://www.npmjs.com/). We'll be installing React and other packages
from npm. npm stands for Node Package Manager and is the world’s largest software registry.

Although it's very easy to [add React to a
website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html), managing and upgrading
packages would be much easier using npm.

We'd also use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for bundling our application.

```bash
yarn add react
yarn add react-dom
yarn add --dev parcel-bundler @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-env
```

The above command will add **react** and **react-dom** to our list of dependencies.
It'll add **parcel-bundler** to our list of dev-dependencies.

> We've added parcel-bundler, @babel/preset-react and @babel/preset-env to our
> dev-dependencies >since we won't need it on production. Our application code
> will be bundled by Parcel and we'll deploy those assets (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to our server.

We also need to adding the following script to our **package.json** file:

```json:package.json
"scripts": {
  "start": "parcel index.html"
}
```

Our **package.json** file should now contain these:

```json:package.json
{
  ....

  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.10.2",
    "@babel/preset-react": "^7.10.1",
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.4"
  }
}

```

We also need to create an **index.html** file in the root of our project and add
a reference to our JavaScript entry point:

```html:index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
      <div id="app"></div>
      <!-- Here 👇 -->
      <script src="./index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's also create a new **index.js** which will be our JavaScript entry point:

```js:index.js
console.log("Hello from Parcel!");
```

Now, we can start our application by running the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

The about application will start running at
[http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/).

Let's start by fetching a list of news from Hacker News API and show it on our
browser. We need to update our **index.js** file with the following code:

```js:index.js
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const ReactPaginationComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch(
      "https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=javascript&hitsPerPage=5&page=0"
    );

    console.log(response);
  };

  return <>Hello</>;
};

ReactDOM.render(<ReactPaginationComponent />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

Now, if we visit [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/), we'll see the following error:

```bash
Uncaught ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined
```

To fix that, we need to add a couple of babel plugins:

```bash
yarn add @babel/plugin-transform-runtime @babel/runtime --dev
```

If we visit [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/), we should be able
to view the page without any errors.

Let's show the data fetched in a list. To do that, we'll need to modify our
**index.js** file:

```js:index.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const ReactPaginationComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch(
      "https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=javascript&hitsPerPage=5&page=0"
    );
    const data = await response.json();

    setData(data.hits);
  };

  const listNode = () => {
    return (
      <ul>
        {data.map((datum, index) => {
          return <li key={index}>{datum.title}</li>;
        })}
      </ul>
    );
  };

  return <div>{listNode()}</div>;
};

ReactDOM.render(<ReactPaginationComponent />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

Here, we're fetching the data from the server and storing it in the `data`
state. In the `listNode` function, we're iterating over this data and showing it
in a list.

If we visit [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/), we should be able
to view the following:

![Skeleton of our list component](/images/content/how-to-create-an-accessible-pagination-component-with-react/7.png)

Let's now add the logic to fetch records from the server based on the selected
page.

First, we need to define two states to store the `totalPages` and the
`currentPage`:

```js:index.js
const [totalPages, setTotalPages] = useState(1);
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
```

We also need to update the `fetchData` function to use the `currentPage`:

```js:index.js
const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=javascript&hitsPerPage=5&page=${currentPage}`
  );
  const data = await response.json();

  setData(data.hits);
  setTotalPages(data.nbPages);
};
```

We also need to add a new `paginationNode` function to show the pagination:

```js:index.js
const paginationNode = () => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {[...Array(totalPages)].map((_, index) => {
        return (
          <li key={index + 1}>
            <button onClick={() => handlePageChange(index + 1)}>
              {index + 1}
            </button>
          </li>
        );
      })}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

Finally, let's update our `return` function and add the `paginationNode`
function to it:

```js:index.js
return (
  <div>
    {listNode()}
    {paginationNode()}
  </div>
);
```

![Pagination list](/images/content/how-to-create-an-accessible-pagination-component-with-react/8.gif)

## Adding styles to our Pagination component
In this section, we'll be adding some styles to our pagination component using
[Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/).

> Theme UI is a library for creating themeable user interfaces based on
constraint-based design principles. Build custom component libraries, design
systems, web applications, Gatsby themes, and more with a flexible API for
best-in-class developer ergonomics.

Let's install the package first:

```bash
yarn add theme-ui
```

Once the package is installed, we need to import `ThemeProvider` and it to our app first:

```js:index.js
import { ThemeProvider } from "theme-ui";

const theme = {
  colors: {
    text,
    background,
    primary,
  },
};

....

return (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    {listNode()}
    {paginationNode()}
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

The values for `text` , `background` and `primary` colors are the props that can
be passed to our component. We can define defaults for those values:

```js:index.js
const ReactPaginationComponent = ({
  text = "#000",
  background = "#fff",
  primary = "#33e",
}) => {

....
```

We need to update our `listNode` and `paginationNode` functions to use `Box`,
`Button` and `Flex` components from Theme UI:

```js:index.js
....

const listNode = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      as="ul"
      sx={{
        listStyleType: "none",
        p: 0,
      }}
    >
      {data.map((datum, index) => {
        return (
          <Box key={index} as="li" mb={2}>
            {datum.title}
          </Box>
        );
      })}
    </Box>
  );
};

const paginationNode = () => {
  return (
    <Flex as="ul" sx={{ listStyleType: "none", p: 0, flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
      {[...Array(totalPages)].map((_, index) => {
        return (
          <Box key={index + 1} as="li" mr={2}>
            <Button onClick={() => handlePageChange(index + 1)}>
              {index + 1}
            </Button>
          </Box>
        );
      })}
    </Flex>
  );
};

....
```

![Styled pagination list](/images/content/how-to-create-an-accessible-pagination-component-with-react/9.png)

Let's update our pagination logic for a better User Experience.

```js:index.js
....

const paginationNode = () => {
  // The logic for generating pagination is taken from
  // https://gist.github.com/kottenator/9d936eb3e4e3c3e02598

  const pageBuffer = 3;
  const startPage = currentPage - pageBuffer;
  const endPage = currentPage + pageBuffer + 1;
  const range = [];
  const rangeWithDots = [];
  let l;

  for (let i = 1; i <= totalPages; i++) {
    if (i == 1 || i == totalPages || (i >= startPage && i < endPage)) {
      range.push(i);
    }
  }

  for (let i of range) {
    if (l) {
      if (i - l === pageBuffer) {
        rangeWithDots.push(l + 1);
      } else if (i - l !== 1) {
        rangeWithDots.push("...");
      }
    }
    rangeWithDots.push(i);

    l = i;
  }

  return (
    <Flex as="ul" sx={{ listStyleType: "none", p: 0, flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
      {rangeWithDots.map((pageNumber, index) => {
        return (
          <Box key={index} as="li" mr={2}>
            <Button
              onClick={() => handlePageChange(pageNumber)}
              disabled={pageNumber === "..."}
            >
              {pageNumber}
            </Button>
          </Box>
        );
      })}
    </Flex>
  );
};

....
```

Now, it looks much better.


## Making our Pagination component theme-able using Theme UI
As we've used the `ThemeProvider` component from Theme UI, our pagination
component supports theming out of the box. We can do so by passing a `primary`
prop to our `ReactPaginationComponent`:

```js:index.js
<ReactPaginationComponent primary="green" />
```

![Adding theme support for our pagination component](/images/content/how-to-create-an-accessible-pagination-component-with-react/11.png)

We can also pass the `text` prop to update the color of the text on the list items.
